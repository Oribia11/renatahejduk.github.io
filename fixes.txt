FIXES for mobile web: 

- make sure its friendly for iphone AND android
- Make the top bar contain everything in a row (name, PL/EN toggle, ENTER SPACES button, menu button)
- make sure any pictures or text are not cut. I can tell for example that the phone number and profile pic are a bit cut on the right side


FIXES for web:

- some pictures are cut and you can only see a part of it ( in project C for example). 
- please add semi transparent arrows so you can tell when you're scrolling pictures


Note: Don't be afraid to restructure it again so everthing fits nicely on the page and is super intuitive. 


IDEAS: 

- Redirect to different web page when entering a project?
