FIXES for mobile web: 

- make sure its friendly for iphone AND android
- Make the top bar contain everything in a row (name, PL/EN toggle, ENTER SPACES button, menu button)
- make sure any pictures or text are not cut. I can tell for example that the phone number and profile pic are a bit cut on the right side


FIXES for web:

- important: picures are still cut (Prject C is an example). I want to see the whole picture with no scrolling. 
- fix the header, the buttons are misaligned and the text is off center
- make sure no buttons overlay with the text on the page
- fix the spacing between all components on the website, they're off and look unnattural 
- instagram button look unnatrual too 
IDEAS: 

- still: Redirect to different web page when entering a certain project?!

Note: Don't be afraid to restructure it again so everthing fits nicely on the page and is super intuitive.
